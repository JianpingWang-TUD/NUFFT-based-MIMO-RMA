# NUFFT-Based Range Migration Algorithm for 3-D Imaging with Irregular Planar MIMO Array
The code implements the Nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) based range migration algorithm for 3-D short-range imaging with an arbitary planar MIMO array.

## Requirement
In the implementation, the NUFFT package (Version 1.3.3) from Greengard, etal is required, which could be found via https://cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html.    

A demonstration of 3-D imaging with the synthetic EM data is given.
